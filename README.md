# GPS Data and how to use.

Here is a pdf link to the key for the GPS data: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSQeheuRQzUMzZbcrXYeWgSFXV9oz47YYHFCGSrdH4HpPfyEQSpLRUVhem5C-X0KixOst4x2pJd2ZGH/pub?gid=0&single=true&output=pdf

Basically, each of the route legs goes either (depot -> stop), (stop -> stop), or (stop->depot)

Each of these routes is in a seperate file marked NAME1-20 and the total is in NAMEFINAL

The reason for this is that we may want to put pauses at a depot or stop and send bag information.

The first Bank is in here, the rest are coming ASAP.
